Code in Place Diagnostic :

In Stanford's CS106A course, at this point in the class, we have to give a diagnostic midterm. It is a 50 minute experience where students solve problems without using the IDE (that is the program that runs your code). It is built to help students self-assess where they can improve and it is part of our system of making great programmers.
