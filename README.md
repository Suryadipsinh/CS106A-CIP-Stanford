This repository showcases my learning during Apr-May 2021, when I was a part of CS106A - Code in Place by, an introductory programming course using the Python language, offered by Stanford University during the time of Covid-19.

10,000 students all over the world were shortlisted from 50,000 applications. In addition to using online resources, we met (via videoconferencing) in a small group, once a week, with someone on the teaching team which comprised of 800+ section leaders throughout the world.

The course was centered around engaging assignments, had weekly live video sections which involved concept reviews & sample coding problems and included a final project. The main objective of this course was to teach students how to program.

Concepts covered:

- Control Flow
- Variables and Expressions
- Functions and Decomposition
- Images
- Lists and Dictionaries
- Text Processing
- Data science
